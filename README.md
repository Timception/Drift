> [!Caution]
> You MUST NOT plug in or disconnect your 3.5mm audio connector when the USB-C is connected, otherwise, you may cook your keyboard.  
> 3.5mm audio connectors are the better choice vs USB-C - don't argue,  
> you will agree with me fast when you try making your own split keyboard.  
>  
> I have been using split keyboards since 2022 with prior knowledge about this issue, zero problems so far.  
> Those who cannot plug in their audio jacks before powering their split keyboard - you have a skill issue, sorry.
> 
> However, mistakes can happen, and you can use a heat gun to remove the MCU and replace it with a new one.  
> Just don't forget to flash firmware on it first.

Special Thanks to [Tecsmith](https://github.com/Tecsmith) for making this keyboard even possible since the start, and for helping with the keyboard layout code.

Special Thanks to [TweetyDaBird](https://github.com/TweetyDaBird) for patiently helping with some issues when RP2040-Zero was still a new mcu for QMK.  

Inspired by Foostan's [Corne Keyboard](https://github.com/foostan/crkbd)  

The reversible pcb design from the [Sofle Keyboard](https://josefadamcik.github.io/SofleKeyboard/) was also an inspiring factor
