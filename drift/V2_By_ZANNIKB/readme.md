# DRIFT split keyboard

DRIFT is a 68 key column-staggered split keyboard made by @timception. It uses the small but powerful RP2040 Zero.

If you are looking for a decent staggered ortholinear ergonomic mechanical keyboard, this should satisfy most needs.

You can use this command to compile the firmware
`qmk compile -kb majin/drift -km vial`
