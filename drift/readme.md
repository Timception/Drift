# DRIFT split keyboard

DRIFT is a 68 key column-staggered split keyboard made by @timception. It uses the small but powerful RP2040 Zero.

V1 is the original Prototype (vanilla drift keyboard).

V2 is the second version with a Buzzer, Music Mode and added support for standard rotary encoders.

V2 is related to files with "Audio" in them.

You can use this command to compile the firmware
`qmk compile -kb majin/drift -km vial`
