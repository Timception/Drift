# Firmware only for Drift Keyboards without switches or jumpers near the 3.5mm connector jack.

=========================================================

This version of the Drift allows for easy plug and play of any side to your computer/device, but may not be detected after a cold boot and will require you to replug in your keyboard.

Split Keyboard's with the RP2040-Zero Microcontroller all have this issue unless a VBUS Pin is assigned with extra circuitry involved (seen in some of the earlier versions).

To prevent newcomers of this hobby from cooking their microcontroller, I have decided to use the EE_HANDS version of the firmware.



This firmware should allow your EE_HANDS version to work without having to unplug and replug the keyboard after a cold boot.

The only drawback is that you will have to wait 10 seconds before the keyboard will be usable after you plug it in.
